imp-note:

REST api is not specific HTTP protocol.
It is a set of architectural principles for designing networked applications.
i.e REST is an architectural style, not a protocol.

but HTTP is the most common protocol used to implement RESTful APIs.

-------------------------------------------------------
steps to design REST api ( Interface )
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Identify the resources: Determine the main entities in your application.
For a money transfer service, these might include:

   - Users
   - Accounts
   - Transactions
   - Transfers
   - ....

2. Know the relationships: Understand how these resources relate to each other.
    For example, a user can have multiple accounts, and an account can have multiple transactions.


3. Define the endpoints for each resource:
Create a list of endpoints that will allow clients to interact with the resources.

   For example:
   /users
   /users/{userId}
   /accounts
   /accounts/{accountId}
   /users/{userId}/accounts

4. Define the operations using HTTP methods:

    read the resource:

    GET -  Retrieve a resource or a collection of resources.
    HEAD - Retrieve metadata about a resource without the response body.
    OPTIONS - Retrieve the supported HTTP methods for a resource.

    write the resource:

    POST - Create a unknown resource.   ( e.g /order )
    POST - to execute action on a resource. ( e.g /order/123/approve, /login , /transfer )
    PUT  - to create or update a known resource. ( e.g /order/123 )
    PATCH - to partial update a known resource. ( e.g /order/123 )
    DELETE - Remove a resource.

    For example:

    - GET /users - Retrieve a list of users
    - GET /users/{userId} - Retrieve a specific user
    - POST /users - Create a new user
    - PUT /users/{userId} - Update a specific user
    - DELETE /users/{userId} - Delete a specific user
    - POST /transfer - Initiate a new transfer



5. Define the request and response formats:

    - Specify the request body format (e.g., JSON, XML) for POST and PUT requests.
    - Define the response format for all endpoints, including success and error responses.
    - Use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the result of the operation (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found).
    - Include relevant headers (e.g., Content-Type, Accept) to specify the format of the request and response.

    For example:

    POST /transfer

    Request Body:
    {
        "fromAccountId": "12345",
        "toAccountId": "67890",
        "amount": 100.00
    }

    Response Body:
    {
        "transactionId": "abc123",
        "status": "pending"
    }

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP Status Codes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1xx: Informational
2xx: Success
3xx: Redirection
4xx: Client Error
5xx: Server Error

Ref : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status


For example:

    Input validation errors: 400 Bad Request
    Authentication errors: 401 Unauthorized
    Duplicate resource errors: 409 Conflict
    Resource not found errors: 404 Not Found


    Empty response: 204 No Content
    Server errors: 500 Internal Server Error
    Service unavailable errors: 503 Service Unavailable
    Rate limiting errors: 429 Too Many Requests


------------------------------------------------------
standard headers | custom headers
------------------------------------------------------

1. Content-Type: Specifies the media type of the resource (e.g., application/json, application/xml).
2. Accept
3. Authorization: Contains credentials for authenticating the client (e.g., Bearer token).
4. Location: Used in responses to indicate the URL of a newly created resource (e.g., after a POST request).
5. Cache-Control: Directives for caching mechanisms in both requests and responses.

6. ETag: A unique identifier for a specific version of a resource, used for caching and conditional requests.
